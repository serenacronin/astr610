Useful codes from ASTR610: Astronomical Instrumentation and Techniques

HW1: Practice with aperture photometry and calibrating CCD images!

HW2: More work with CCD images, this time dealing with charge build-up.

Adding a fun code from ASTR680: High Energy Astrophysics. This code calculates the black hole spin parameter as it accretes matter.
